## 🧠 How It Works

1. When the user visits the site, the **React app** loads in the browser.
2. The API responds with a random excuse in JSON format:

```json
{
  "reason": "This feels like something Future Me would yell at Present Me for agreeing to."
}
````

3. The message is displayed in a glowing neon card.
4. Clicking **"Ask again"** fetches a new random response.
